follow these steps to make it work :
create a directory called "static"
in the static directory create 3 other directories : "feature" "img" "uploaded"

you should have this layout now : 
static/feature
static/img
static/uplaoded
templates/index
feature_extraction
offline
server

go ahead now and put somme pictures in static/img

run the offline.py file

wait for it to finish 

then run the server.py file 

give it a minute or two then it ll give you a link in the console

click it upload a file

every uploaded file will go in the static/uploaded in order to increase the accuracy of the engine
